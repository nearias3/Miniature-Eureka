# Note Taker Starter Code

  This project is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

  ## Description
  The purpose of this application is to provide users with a space to take notes. Users can input their notes title and text, then save these notes on their browser. They are dynamically added to the code into the db.json file and stored for their future use. Users can also delete the notes they no longer want to keep through the browser (or by deleting them from the code). The app makes use of several API Endpoints including GET to retrieve the saved notes, POST to save new notes, and DELETE to delete notes according to their ID. In order to assign a unique ID to each note, I utilized the npm tool uuid.
